## About my Website

This Website sells Peso Pluma merchandise.

On my website there is a Home, Log in, Registration, Products and Checkout page.

## Home Page 

At the top of this page and all my pages, I have my nav bar with the Peso Pluma logo.

On my home page I have a video of Peso Pluma preforming. 
Below that I have 2 short paragraphs that descibe the artist and motive for my website. I also list what items I have for sale. Below that, I have his tour listing. 

This is all diplayed infront of a gradient background that goes from black to purple. 
The gradient effect is applied on all pages for consistency.

At the very bottom, is his logo that will take the user back to the home page. This is on every page for consistency.
