This Website sells Peso Pluma merchandise.

On my website there is a Home, Log in, Registration, Products and Checkout page.

Special attributes such as input boxes, button and image display, have all been made poossible with bootstrap!

On my home page I have a video of Peso Pluma preforming.

Right below that, I have a quote from Peso, "We Are Peso Pluma."
