## About my Website

This Website sells Peso Pluma merchandise.

On my website there is a Home, Log in, Registration, Products and Checkout page.

## Home Page 

At the top of this page and all my pages, I have a responsive nav bar with the Peso Pluma logo that takes the user back to the home page.

On my home page I have a video of Peso Pluma preforming. 
Below that I have 2 short paragraphs that descibe the artist and motive for my website. I also list what items I have for sale. Below that, I have his tour listing. 

This is all diplayed infront of a gradient background that goes from black to purple. 
The gradient effect is applied on all pages for consistency.

At the very bottom, is his logo that will take the user back to the home page. This is on every page for consistency.

## Login Page

The login page has 2 input boxes. The top box allows the user to input their email address. The bottom box allows the user to input their password. These two inputs have respecable html attributes: required, min length and email attributes. 
These input boxes are followed by a "Register" button and a "Remember Me" checkbox. 
If the user does not have an account, they can create one with a link that's bellow the checkbox. This link sends the user to the Register page.
